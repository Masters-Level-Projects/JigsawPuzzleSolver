# Jigsaw Puzzle Solver
Three approaches were considered for our methods: CNN, LSTM and AutoEncoder

A segment of Open-Images dataset was considered for our evaluation (please visit https://opensource.google/projects/open-images-dataset for more info). The CNN and LSTM were implemented in Tensoerflow but the Autoencoder code was written in Keras.

Authors of the Code-
1. CNN method - Subhranil Bagchi
2. LSTM method - Anurag Banerjee
3. AutoEncoder based - Anurag Mehta
